**Accenture Social Buzz Project Brief: 📊**

---

**📜 Background**

Social Buzz was founded in 2008 by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate—one from London and the other from San Francisco. They saw an opportunity to innovate by creating a platform focused purely on content, rather than individuals. On Social Buzz, all users remain anonymous, and their content is prioritized based on over 100 different types of reactions, beyond simple likes and comments. The platform has grown rapidly, reaching 500 million active users monthly. 

The scale of their data is immense, with over 100,000 pieces of content (including text, images, videos, and GIFs) uploaded daily. Managing this unstructured data requires advanced technology, which is maintained by a highly technical team of 200 people. Due to their exponential growth, Social Buzz needs support to effectively manage this scale and prepare for a successful IPO.
